The link to our public gitHub repository is https://github.com/vandrews7/CS4518-Programming3, for ease of grading and partial credit opportunities.
Part 1 and most of part 2 are submitted in the code base. The integration of Gson was not able to be completed, so we did not merge it into our main branch, which is the code we submitted.

Part 1 can be evaluated through the code that was submitted, but also if you would like to assess it seperately it can be evaluated on the feature/Part1 branch in our gitHub repository.

Part 2 can be partially evaluated through the code that was submitted, but if there is an opportunity for partial credit for the Gson implementation, then the remaining part can be evaluated on the feature/Part2 branch on our GitHub repo.

Thank you!
