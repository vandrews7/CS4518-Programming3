Each part of the project has a separate branch on our public git repo, for ease of giving credit/partial credit and seeing the separate parts of the assignment: https://github.com/vandrews7/CS4518-Programming2 (also linked in the writeup)
The master branch of the repo, which is what was submitted as the debug APK, includes all of our working features.

Part 1:
Part 1 can be assessed through the screenshots and details included in the write up, the code, and by clicking the save button when running the app. There should be no problems with part 1.

Part 2:
Part 2 can be assessed through the writeup and through inspecting the code for GameFragment. There should be no problems with part 2.

Part 3:
Part 3 can be assessed through the writeup and through inspection of the code. Notice that the Recycler View is called in MainActivity. There should be no problems.

Part 4:
Part 4 can be assess through inspection of the xml file res/layout/list_item_game.xml. There should be no problems.

Part 5: (not merged into master)
In part 5 we encountered problems with the gradle build when using kapt. The specific error we got was regarding "Task :app:kaptDebugKotlin". We communicated with Professor Guo, but we're unable to solve this problem. Because of this, on branch feature/Part5 the app either crashes or fails to build.
Most of the code that would be required for part 5 is implemented, but untested because we were never able to get it to work. If there is an opportunity for partial credit, part 5 can be assessed through inspection of the code on GitHub in branch feature/Part5.

Part 6: (most of it not merged into master)
We encountered problems implementing part 6 because we were unable to get the database to work, so the integration was not possible. We made progress on part 6, so the itemViews in the recyclerView can be clicked. If there is an opportunity for partial credit, part 6 can be assessed through the code in GitHub on the branch feature/Part6.

The idea of not merging the broken code into master, but including it in the branches was because we wanted to submit a working model of our app, while also including the code to be assessed.
